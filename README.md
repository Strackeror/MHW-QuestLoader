## Build instructions

### Prerequisites

- [CMake >= 3.19](https://cmake.org/download/)
- Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compiler toolset
  - This can be installed with Visual Studio installer :vomiting_face:
  - OR by installing [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#other) separately :muscle:

### Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/ -A x64
```

You can find the solution in _build/_ if you want to open it with Visual Studio.

If you want to compile from the cli:

```bash
cmake --build build/ --config <Configuration>
```

> `--config` is optional if you just want Debug
